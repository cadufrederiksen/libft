The **Libft** project is the first step into the world of 42 programming. It challenges students to recreate standard C functions from scratch, promoting a deep understanding of fundamental concepts and best practices.

## 📋 Project Objective

🔹 **Deeply understand** how standard C functions work by recreating them from scratch.  
🔹 **Strengthen** concepts such as memory manipulation, string management, and dynamic data structures.  
🔹 **Promote best practices** like using version control (GIT) and code standardization with Norminette.

## 📚 Main Concepts

- 🧠 **Memory Manipulation**: allocation, deallocation, and efficient management.
- 🧵 **String Handling**: analysis, modification, and processing of character arrays.
- 🔄 **Type Conversion**: transformations between different data formats.
- 🔤 **Character Operations**: specific manipulations of characters.
- 🔗 **Linked Lists**: creation and use of dynamic data structures.
